cmyth roku
----------

This repository contains both the client application that runs on your
Roku device, as well as the server the client talks to.  The server acts
as a bridge between the Roku client and your MythTV backend.

In order to install the client on your device, you will do the following:

	$ make
	$ ROKU_DEV_TARGET=<target> make install

Where <target> is the hostname or IP address of your Roku device.

In order to run the daemon, you have to provide the hostname or IP address
of your MythTV backend:

	$ cmrd.py --server <backend>

The cmrd.py daemon is implemented in Python, and requires the cmyth Python
module to be installed.  You can get the cmyth code which contains the Python
language bindings here:

To debug the Brightscript client code, you can telnet to the Roku device at
port 8085.  This will allow you to see all the print messages.
